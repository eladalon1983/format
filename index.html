        Pre-existing mechanisms such as {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} allow Web applications to
            initiate screen-capture. If the user chooses to share a tab, the capturing application has a
        video {{MediaStreamTrack}}. Mechanisms such as [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] allow
        this track to be mutated - performing some operation on the captured frames. (In the case of
        [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]], this mutation consists of cropping.)
