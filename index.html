                 Pre-existing mechanisms such as {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} allow Web applications to
        initiate screen-capture. If the user chooses to share a tab, the capturing application has a
        video {{MediaStreamTrack}}. Mechanisms such as [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] allow
        this track to be mutated - performing some operation on the captured frames. (In the case of
        [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]], this mutation consists of cropping.)
    </p>
  <p>
        This document introduces a new mutation mechanism which we name "restriction". After a Web
        application "restricts" a video track to a given target-element, frames produced on that
        video track only consist information from the target-element and (and its descendants).
        Phrased differently, the track becomes a capture of the DOM sub-tree rooted at the
        target-element.
